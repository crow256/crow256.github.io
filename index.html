        <h1>Warys <q>Quotes</q></h1>
        <p>for those who didn't get it, this is the country of variswaa from the 14R (a.k.a Warys room). meaning that here you will find every part of Varismaa including, to everyone surprise, the crude cave. after the events of 1914 Warys trapped the crude cave and bringed it to the 14 simulation and displayed on this page. i also got some others unknow things about the crow death (a.k.a the most important event in the 14R). and the complete past and future of 14R in this page with the help of Warys.</p>
